// This is the `ps` module. It is responsible for housing functionality
// specific to Patch Stack as a conceptual level.  It is responsible for
// consuming functionality from other modules like the `git` and `utils`
// modules to build a higher level abstraction around the concepts of Patch
// Stack. Think of this as the public interface for a Patch Stack library that
// will be consumed by each of the subcommand specific modules.
//
// All code fitting that description belongs here.
